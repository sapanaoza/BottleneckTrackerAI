 
# BottleneckTrackerAI

BottleneckTrackerAI is an intelligent multi-agent system built with the Agent Development Kit (ADK). It continuously monitors machine runtime data, detects bottlenecks, and sends automated email alerts with detailed reports. The system simulates Google Cloud Pub/Sub messaging for real-time data processing and is designed to scale with cloud-native architecture.

## Features

- Multi-agent system for real-time bottleneck detection
- Data collection and analysis of machine runtime metrics
- Automated email notifications with detailed CSV/JSON reports
- Simulated Pub/Sub messaging for inter-agent communication
- Ready for deployment on cloud platforms like Google Cloud

## Technologies Used

- Java and Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub (simulated)
- Jakarta Mail API for email notifications
- JSON and CSV data formats

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11+
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management
